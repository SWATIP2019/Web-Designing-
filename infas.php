	            <h4 style="color:green;">Civil Infrastructure</h4>
	            <p>Civil engineering is not all about fancy buildings â€“ it is about maintaining vital infrastructure. When people think of famous civil engineers from the past, they think of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Joseph Bazalgette, the great engineer of the Victorian age who saved London from cholera by constructing new sewers.</p>
	            <p>They must also find ways to deliver the infrastructure needed when there is little money to pay for it. Put simply, civil engineers have to come up with solutions to complex problems and implement them; they literally shape the world people live in. </p>

									  	<p>Structural designing is fundamental to the civil engineering discipline as it deals directly with the structural strength and integrity of buildings or structures. It includes planning, designing, and structural analysis of large structures like skyscrapers, bridges, tunnels, towers, and even off-shore structures like oil rigs.</p>
									  </div>
									  <div class="tab-pane container p-0 fade" id="home2">
									  	<p>Structural designing provide all the crucial information about walls, floors and more to ensure that the structure is built to be safe and sound. It is essential for civil engineers to work with design aesthetics and build structures that can withstand its loads and pressures.</p>
									  </div>
									  <div class="tab-pane container p-0 fade" id="home3">
									  	<p>Civil engineers are required to perform a thorough and detailed analysis of the structure with respect to the principles of the structural design. This helps to ensure that the new structure meets up all the necessary safety criteria and design codes.</p>
