	            <p>The implementation of major investment projects and new capital construction activities within the framework of the State Programs of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) require a large volume of concrete mixes and mortars. One of the main components of these mixtures is a non-metallic building material â€“ a large and fine aggregate. The republic has huge reserves of quartz sand. The quartz sands of the Bestyakhskiy, Nizhne-Bestyakhskiy and Diring-Etege deposits are suitable for the production of silicate concrete products, including autoclaved cellular concrete. </p>

					<h4 style="color:green;">Construction Materials Industry</h4>
			
	           
	          <p> The construction materials industry consists of a wide range of companies involved in the mining, quarrying, and processing of raw materials used for both heavy and building construction. Materials such as cement, sand and gravel, clay, concrete, and marble are used in this industry. The purchase price of materials can also be one of the main determinants in deciding what material to use in construction projects. Apart from economic costs, costs derived from pollution and energy, as well as social aspects must be considered in choosing building materials.
