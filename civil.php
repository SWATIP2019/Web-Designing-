	            <h2 class="mb-4">Civil Infrastructure</h2>
	            <p>Civil engineering is not all about fancy buildings â€“ it is about maintaining vital infrastructure. When people think of famous civil engineers from the past, they think of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Joseph Bazalgette, the great engineer of the Victorian age who saved London from cholera by constructing new sewers.</p>
	            <p>They must also find ways to deliver the infrastructure needed when there is little money to pay for it. Put simply, civil engineers have to come up with solutions to complex problems and implement them; they literally shape the world people live in. </p>

                <p>Structural designing is fundamental to the civil
				engineering discipline as it deals directly with 
				the structural strength and integrity of buildings 
				or structures. It includes planning, designing, 
				and structural analysis of large structures like
				skyscrapers, bridges, tunnels, towers, and even
				off-shore structures like oil rigs.</p>

				with respect to the principles of the structural design. This helps to ensure that the new
				structure meets up all the necessary safety criteria and design codes.</p>
